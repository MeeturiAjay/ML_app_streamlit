🌿 Machine Learning Web App - Iris Species Prediction
Welcome to the Iris Species Prediction web application! 🚀 This is a user-friendly and interactive machine learning application built using Streamlit, allowing users to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.

✨ Features
🔹 Simple & Interactive UI – A clean, minimal, and easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.
🔹 Real-time Predictions – Just adjust the sliders to input feature values, and instantly see the predicted species.
🔹 Pre-trained Machine Learning Model – Uses a trained model on the famous Iris dataset.
🔹 Lightweight & Fast – The app runs smoothly without any lag.

🛠 Tech Stack
This project is built using the following technologies:

💻 Python – The backbone of our machine learning implementation.
📦 Streamlit – For creating an interactive web app with ease.
🧠 Scikit-Learn – Used for training the classification model.
📁 Pickle – To store and load the trained model efficiently.

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Open the app and set the values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using the sliders.
2️⃣ Click on "Predict Species" to see the predicted iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
3️⃣ The app instantly displays the result with a success message!

📌 About the Model
The model used in this app is trained on the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning. It includes three species of iris flowers and their corresponding sepal & petal measurements. We used a classification algorithm to build the model, which is saved using Pickle for easy loading into the app.

🎯 Why This Project?
🔹 Demonstrates how machine learning models can be deployed in a simple web app.
🔹 A great starting point for beginners in ML & web development.
🔹 Showcases real-world applications of ML models beyond Jupyter notebooks.
